/**
 * A test case consists of a set of unit tests related to a certain code
 * component.
 *
 * In order to write unit tests, write methods annotated with the "@Test"
 * metadata element. Each test test will be executed sequentially.
 *
 * There also may be one method annotated "@Before" - it will be executed before
 * each test method. The "@After" tag may also be used in the same fashion - the
 * method will then be executed after the test method.
 *
 * For test case initialisation and termination, "@BeforeClass" and
 * "@AfterClass" may be used on methods to have them exectuted, respectively,
 * before all the tests are ran and after all the tests are ran. There can only
 * be one "@BeforeClass" and one "@AfterClass"-annotated method.
